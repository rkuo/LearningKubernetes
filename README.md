# LearningKubernetes

## There are two leaning files:
* one is based on this directory:file name = learningKubernetesOnGcloud.md
* the other one is base on /Users/rkuo/code/coreos-kubernetes/single-node, filename = learningKubernetesOnCoreOS-SingleNodes.md

Gcloud version works, single node version uses Vagrant, but does not work.
